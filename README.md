# Drawing Application
This is my school project for University of London.

## Tools Extensions
### 1. Stamp Tool
This tool lets to paste/stamp any image on the canvas. When you select this tool you get 2 options populated on bottom part:
 - An option to upload image
 - A slider to chose size of the image

You can see the image live wherever your cursor goes and when you click the image is placed on canvas and you still have the live preview image following where the mouse goes.

### 2. Scissor/Cut Tool

### 3. Shape Tool

### 4. Erasor Tool

## Added Features
 - Option to name the saved file when clicking "Save image"

## Ideas
 - Option to set width/heigh of the canvas
 - Use HTML5 Color Picker for `colorP`



## ~~Weekly~~ Daily Logs
Due to covid and some personal reasons I wasn't able to keep up with studies and this all project was done under 1 week. 


### 16 September, 2020
 - Downloaded template project.
 - Started making StampTool
 - The icons weren't to my liking, so changed them from iconfinder.com
 - Added option to rename file when saving image and styled the buttons
 - Finished stamp tool, it has ability for user to upload any image and increase/decrease it's size.
 - Made a private github repo and added readme.md to keep track of features, extensions, logs and resources list.
 - **Known issue:** When clicking outside the canvas, the stamp tool still draws the image.

_Disclaimer: That's why no weekly logs, only daily. I've been coding professionally for 8 years, so 1 week is no big deal._
