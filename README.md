# Drawing Application
This is my school project for University of London.

## Tools Extensions
### 1. Stamp Tool
This tool lets to paste/stamp any image on the canvas. When you select this tool you get 2 options populated on bottom part:
 - An option to upload image
 - A slider to chose size of the image
 - TODO: Option to select built-in images

You can see the image live wherever your cursor goes and when you click the image is placed on canvas and you still have the live preview image following where the mouse goes.

### 2. Eraser Tool
This tool erases anything from the canvas (in basic terms, it only paints white on the canvas). Has the option to:
 - Select shape of eraser (boxed, round or triangle)
 - Increase/Decrease the size of eraser with a slider


### 3. Cut Tool
TODO

## Added Features
 - Option to name the saved file when clicking "Save image"

## Ideas
 - Option to set width/heigh of the canvas
 - Use HTML5 Color Picker for `colorP`

_Disclaimer: Due to covid and some personal reasons I wasn't able to keep up with studies and this all project was done under 1 week. That's why no weekly logs, only daily. I've been coding professionally for 8 years, so 1 week is no big deal._
